## AE Modular Format

Discovering the AE Modular format was the impetus of [clectric.diy](https://clectric.diy). The format is designed to be hackable. It's called Abused Electronics (AE) Modular after all.

Information about the AE Modular format, and the modules available for it, can be found on the [AE Modular Wiki](https://wiki.aemodular.com/). Including a full [AE Modular Technical Guide](https://wiki.aemodular.com/#/diy/aemodular-technical-guide.md) that provides most of the specifications of the format. Tangible Waves also shared the [AE Modular Mechanical Specs in PDF format](source/Format/AEmodular_HW_specs_DIY.pdf).

Our goal here is to fill some missing pieces and collect clectric.diy community specific information over time.

### Stack Height

When designing modules for the AE Modular format, the most challenging physical constraint is the stack height.

The format reference has a total stack height of approximately 26mm and includes a 15mm standoff at the bottom and an 8mm standoff between the panel and the pcb. There are reasons that you may want to bend, or even break, this standard. For instance the ubiquitous "Thonkiconn" jacks fit best with a 10mm standoff between the panel and pcb. Changes are not uncommon with other modules.  

Obviously, to keep the overall height within the standard for the format, every mm that you add to the upper standoff should be removed from the lower one. The two major caveats here are:
1. you have to accomotate the height of the bus connector with any changes that you make, and
2. your changes will most likely make the module incompatable with the QUICKSWAP cases.

### Projects and Hardware

The [AE Modular Wiki](https://wiki.aemodular.com/) also contains information for other [DIY Projects](https://wiki.aemodular.com/#/diy/) for AE modules. Dig deep into that site because there are resources available for more that just AE Modular.

Tangible Waves, and others, make hardware modules specifically targeted to the SynthDIY community.

##### BRAEDBOARD Module

The BRAEDBOARD Module is obviously for Synth DIY'ers.

From its documentation:
> The BRAEDBOARD module contains a breadboard area for solderless electronics prototyping so you can experiment with any kind of analog or digital electronics and make your first steps into electronics, starting with simple circuits for beginners to developing your own module.

Some electronic components are provided with it to get you started with your own [Synth DIY Projects](https://wiki.aemodular.com/#/diy/).

##### DIY Kit Module

Once you have tested out your circuit on the BRAEDBOARD, you may be ready to put it into your rack. The [DIY Kit](https://wiki.aemodular.com/#/modules/diy-kit) can help.

The [DIY Module Schematic](source/DIY-Kit/DIY-module-schematic.pdf) is available on that site.

#### clectric.diy

Our community has several projects planned for the AE Modular format. These include an [AE version of the classic Atari Punk Console (APC)](https://clectric.diy/APC-AE/) and an [AE version of the Electrosmith Pod based on the Daisy Seed microcontroller](https://clectric.diy/Spark-AE/).
