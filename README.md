AE Modular was the impetus of [clectric.diy](https://clectric.diy). The format is designed to be hackable. It's called Abused Electronics (AE) Modular after all.

Information about the AE Modular format and the modules available for it can be found on the [AE Modular Wiki](https://wiki.aemodular.com/). Including a full [AE Modular Technical Guide](https://wiki.aemodular.com/#/diy/aemodular-technical-guide.md) that provides the specifications of the format.

There is a [DIY Projects](https://wiki.aemodular.com/#/diy) page for information about building your own modules. Dig deep into that site because there resources available for more that just AE Modular.

Tangible Waves, and others, make hardware modules specifically targeted to the SynthDIY community.

## BRAEDBOARD Module

The BRAEDBOARD Module is obviously for SynthDIY'ers.

From the site:
> The BRAEDBOARD module contains a breadboard area for solderless electronics prototyping so you can experiment with any kind of analog or digital electronics and make your first steps into electronics, starting with simple circuits for beginners to developing your own module.

Some electronic components are provided with it to get you started with your own [DIY Projects](https://wiki.aemodular.com/#/diy).

## DIY Kit Module

Once you have tested out your circuit on the BRAEDBOARD, you may be ready to put it into your rack. The [DIY Kit](https://wiki.aemodular.com/#/modules/diy-kit) can help.

The [DIY Module Schematic](source/DIY-Kit/DIY-module-schematic.pdf) is available on that site.

[clectric.diy](https://clectric.diy) provides open-sourced hardware and software for the SynthDIY Community.

## APC-AE

The [APC-AE](https://clectric.diy/APC-AE) is a classic [Atari Punk Console](https://sdiy.info/wiki/Atari_Punk_Console) adapted to the AE Format.

If you're not ready to take the plunge into AE Modular yet, the [APC](https://clectric.diy/APC) is a stripped down version of the APC-AE, which can be easily converted to fit in your AE Modular rack when you're ready.

## Spark-AE

The [Spark-AE](https://clectric.diy/Spark-AE) is an AE Modular format clone of the [Daisy Pod](https://daisy.audio/product/Daisy-Pod/) which is based on the [Daisy Seed](https://daisy.audio/hardware/Seed/) embedded DSP module.
