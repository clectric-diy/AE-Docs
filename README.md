## AE Modular Format

Discovering the AE Modular format was the impetus of [clectric.diy](https://clectric.diy). The format is designed to be hackable. It's called Abused Electronics (AE) Modular after all.

Information about the AE Modular format, and the modules available for it, can be found on the [AE Modular Wiki](https://wiki.aemodular.com/). Including a full [AE Modular Technical Guide](https://wiki.aemodular.com/#/diy/aemodular-technical-guide.md) that provides most of the specifications of the format. Our goal here is to fill some missing pieces and collect clectric.diy community specific information over time.

The [AE Modular Wiki](https://wiki.aemodular.com/) also contains information for other [DIY Projects](https://wiki.aemodular.com/#/diy/) for AE modules. Dig deep into that site because there are resources available for more that just AE Modular.

## Hardware for SynthDIY

Tangible Waves, and others, make hardware modules specifically targeted to the SynthDIY community.

### Tangible Waves

#### BRAEDBOARD Module

The BRAEDBOARD Module is obviously for SynthDIY'ers.

From its documentation:
> The BRAEDBOARD module contains a breadboard area for solderless electronics prototyping so you can experiment with any kind of analog or digital electronics and make your first steps into electronics, starting with simple circuits for beginners to developing your own module.

Some electronic components are provided with it to get you started with your own [DIY Projects](https://wiki.aemodular.com/#/diy/).

#### DIY Kit Module

Once you have tested out your circuit on the BRAEDBOARD, you may be ready to put it into your rack. The [DIY Kit](https://wiki.aemodular.com/#/modules/diy-kit) can help.

The [DIY Module Schematic](source/DIY-Kit/DIY-module-schematic.pdf) is available on that site.
